1. GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
2. WHEN I open the planner THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
4. WHEN I scroll down THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
6. WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
7. WHEN I click into a timeblock THEN I can enter an event
8. WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
9. WHEN I refresh the page THEN the saved events persist


The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
